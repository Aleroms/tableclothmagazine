Described in a Twitter shitpost[^1], all
games fall into the two categories,
“menus” and “parkour.” _Monster
Hunter_ to me is menus[^2]. _Monster
Hunter_ Rise features a lot of parkour,
zooming all over the map with
wirebugs, and it is still menus.

The menu players spend the most time
in, far above others, is the armor
crafting screen. Alongside a raw
defense value, each piece of armor can
have multiple “skills” affecting
gameplay. Between the five slots,
stacking skills to higher levels
increases their effect. So it becomes an
issue of prioritization. A player might
continue wearing armor with Evade
Extender despite being able to craft
armor with better defense. Then they
may abandon it to stack Attack Boost
with another piece of armor. In the
endgame, the whole set of armor
matters, and it is impossible to
focus on only one piece at a time. You’d want to
maximize multiple high priority skills, but it’s
not clear what armor you would need to make
that skill set, or if it is even possible. Planning or
calculating wrong costs your time (not **un**well
spent) hunting to gather all the materials.

There’s a secret technique to get around this. It
is called, “look up your weapon type on
/r/monsterhuntermeta.” But that gives you
maximum DPS builds, which is cool in theory,
but hard to pilot in practice. You can instead find
set builder web apps. These builders are not fast.
You input your desired skills, and it dumps out a
list of armor sets containing them, sorted by
defense. From an outside perspective (since all
their JavaScript is obfuscated), they seem to be
using a slow but very powerful strategy known
to solve all NP-Hard problems. It is called
“Guess and Check.” But we’re impatient. We’re
here to reduce time spent building sets, not
spend the same amount of time tabbed out on a
calculator.

## Getting with the Program

What we have is some sort of “assignment
problem,” assigning armor to slots to meet
certain skill targets. But let’s take a small
detour to a “maximization problem,”
choosing armor to maximize, well, to be
determined. It sounds harder and more
specific than assignment, but it will work
well for us.

Linear programming is a special type of
maximization problem. It has nothing to
do with computer programming. It was
named by mathematicians when
programming meant scheduling (a classic
example of an assignment problem). Also
a calculator used to refer to a person who
made calculations as their job. Weird
times.

Maximization problems are similar to
algebra (and calculus) problems like
“what is the largest area rectangle with a
given perimeter?” Without cheating by
knowing squares are the best[^3], you would
vary one side’s length, and graph out the
area. The peak of the graph would be the
max area.

Linear programs have the same goal, but
follow a very specific pattern that makes
it fast to solve with a computer (or a very
dedicated person. A calculator. Hmm). We
don’t care how we solve them in this
article, you can import a library like
numpy to do it. But we do need to know
exactly what they are. They are usually
stated like:

Find a vector x that maximizes **cTx**, given
A**x** ≤ **b**.

A very boring example in 1D is:
Maximize -2x, where -3x ≤ 4 and 5x ≤ 6.
Here, the row vector cT is -2. Matrix A
and vector **b** have the same height of 2,
the number of inequalities. A has width 1,
to match the height of **x**. The answer?
-4/3.

To visualize a problem in higher
dimensions, imagine a whatever
dimension space (like 2 or 3) with vectors
**x** and **c**. As the solver, we can control **x**
but not **c**. We want the projection of **x** on **c**
to be as long as possible. It’s nice if vector
**x** is bounded, so it is inside a box.
(Otherwise we just make any arbitrarily
long **x**.) We can make the projection better
by rotating **x** to point more in the same
direction as **c**, or making **x** longer (if they
make an acute angle, otherwise shorter is
better). This might be familiar as the
dot product, which is the exact same as
**cTx**. One of the vertices of the
bounding box must be a maximum.
You should be able to visualize how
this makes sense.

We can constrain x more with a vector
a. The constraint **aTx** ≤ 1 defines a
halfspace. As the name suggests, they
split space (and maybe our box) by a
plane, and keep one side. It’s equally
as expressive to say **aTx** ≤ **b**, which
usually has some nice “meaning” in
the context of a problem. A problem
can have multiple halfspaces, and their
intersection including our box (aka the
“feasible region”) will always be a
convex shape[^4], like our starting box[^5].
We can express multiple halfspaces by
stacking multiple **aT** row vectors into a
matrix A, and the **b** constants into a
vector **b**. (This vector is in a different
space than the one **x** and **c** are in.
Matrix A meaningfully transforms **x**
into the same space as **b** to be
constrained.) One vertex of the convex
shape will always be a maximum! That sure is some abstract nonsense.
Fortunately, the following is a very contrived but
motivating example involving Monster Hunter.

## They Did the Monster Math

Wearing armor gives skills additively, so a
helmet with Evade Extender 2 and a chestplate
with Evade Extender 2 gives you Evade
Extender 4. So, armor skills form a vector space,
each skill being its own dimension. Each armor
is a vector in that space (Figure 1). This linearity
is what would give some nerd the idea of linear
programming. As a player, we have a list of
desired armor skills for our set. We can use that
as a lower bound, part of vector **b**. (Some
solvers only accept upper bounds. To make a
lower bound into an upper bound, negate both
sides.) Then any valid result must have those
skills. Now we need to describe **A** and **x**.

![linear algebra](/issues/1/article/5/linearAlgebra.png)

_Figure 1: Armor as vectors in the space of
armor skills. This shows the subspace of
two skill dimensions._

The vector space containing **b** (armor
skills) is not related to **x**. We’d want **x** to
represent armor somehow. There are five
armor slots, but a 5D vector can’t work.
Instead, let’s add some indirection.

We know we can only wear one helmet at
a time. If we remove that restriction
temporarily, we can represent wearing
each helmet as its own element in **x**.
Then, we can re-add that restriction in **Ax**
≤ **b**. We’d also have to do the same for
every other type of armor, so now **x** is a
very high dimensional vector, one for
each armor in the game. We can create a
row **a^T** that indicates whether the armor in
**x** is a helmet. Then **aTx** represents the sum
of the number of helmets worn. Naturally
we’d want to upper bound that by 1. We
can do this for the five armor types to
build a matrix A1 and bounds b1. If this is a little sus, remember a vertex of
the feasible region must be an optimal
answer. While the space represents
wearing a real number of all armor, all the
vertices all represent wearing 0 or 1 of
each armor[^6]! This is demonstrated in
Figure 2 with three armors.

![graphs](/issues/1/article/5/graphs.png)

_Figure 2: Cross sections of the feasible
region. From left to right, two related
armor, two unrelated armor, and their 3D
span._

We had a bound on the desired armor
skills, which we’ll now call **b2**. We’d need
matrix **A2** to match, to transform **x** into the
space of armor skills. One nice way to
think through this is to use the basis
vectors of **x**’s space, which would be one
armor alone. This gives you a column of
A2, which is a vector of skills of that
armor. This lets you build **A2** column by
column. Alternatively, each row of **A2**
indicates how much each armor has a
specific skill.

Lastly, we’re missing **c**, anything[^7] to
maximize. You could pick a random
vector (fun!) and it would give you a
random result within the constraints,
arbitrarily prioritizing some armor. More
usefully, we can maximize defense, since
not dying is the best DPS. Thankfully,
defense also acts linearly. The column **c**
would represent the defense of each armor
in **x**. Alternatively, we can also try to
improve a set’s skills. We can maximize a
skill given already existing skills. Then **c**
would represent how much of the skill
each armor has.

We reformulated the problem! Now we
can choose what set to build real quickly.
We’d need to yoink the game data from
somewhere, build matrix **A** and vectors **b**
and **c**, pass it to a solver, and it works!
(Almost. It can give garbage answers, like
wearing half of two helmets. That would
be a cool feature.)

## Returning to Camp

There are a few ways to go from our basic
model. For specific games (like _Monster
Hunter Wilds_ when that comes out!), how
can we extend our linear program to
match its features? What are the
limitations? Why linear programming?

I have an implementation of this[^8] for
_World_ in a Jupyter Notebook (hence the
numpy mention). Without explaining how
(exercise for the reader), I was able to
model decorations with more dimensions
of **x** and decoration slots as constraints. I
can also provide a list of skills and their
highest level that can be added to a given
set of skills. I’ve experimented with
maximizing other things. Maximizing
skill count gives you awkward results,
since all skills are valued equally, but
weighting each skill gives more
reasonable results.

Should you maximize over skills, skills
are valued past their max level. Upper
bounding it may possibly (but under
extreme and awkward circumstances)
miss out on sets that would work. You
can’t remove this overvaluing since it
would not be linear. It’s probably fine
though.

Similarly, linear programming also cannot maximize DPS[^9] since that is not linear with skills.
For example, Attack Boost gives flat or percent increases to attack depending on level. The
user has to optimize offensive skills themselves, but at least some work is removed. Attack
Boost’s conditional increase is at least convex! No skill is actively harmful to DPS. So,
someone could experiment with stronger forms of convex optimization.

We sometimes get garbage non- integer answers as an artifact of linear programming and our
“armor space” indirection. The quick fix in numpy is turning on “integrality” to restrict the
answer to integers. Integer Linear Programming is always right while letting us use the same
problem statement. But then why not use that in the first place?

We choose linear programming for speed. Integer Linear Programming is slower and more
powerful , although to be honest we aren’t doing anything particularly extreme that would
cause slowdown. The real reason I chose linear programming is to fit a square peg in a round
hole. The fact it works is novel and weird. Mapping from the game to the problem was a
dumb fun experiment with a neat result that I hope I did justice to.
