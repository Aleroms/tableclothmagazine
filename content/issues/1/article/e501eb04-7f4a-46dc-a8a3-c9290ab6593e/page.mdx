_Note: Before reading this article, if you don’t want to be spoiled,
please make sure you have played the game at least once. It’s a_
[browser game](https://saffrona.itch.io/who-wants-to-be-reincarnated) _that’s less than 10 minutes long._

The idea for _Who Wants to be Reincarnated_ popped into my mind during my
freshman year of college. It wasn’t until 4 years later that I actually created it.

During one of my humanities courses, we learned about Cornelia
Hesse-Honegger, who paints mutated insects from areas affected by radiation,
like Chernobyl. Part of learning about her was to ask questions about
speciesism, a term used to describe treating beings differently because of their
species (typically used to describe humans treating themselves as superior to
other species). Was speciesism a real, important issue? Did we care about the
mutations in these insects? Would we care more if it had been a different
species, like dogs or cats?

For this same course, we had an optional project to create a piece of art
inspired by what we learned. This is where I had the idea to create a game
where you choose what animals a person would reincarnate into, as a way of
exploring which animals were considered more “valuable”.

I never completed that project because I thought it wouldn’t be
very “fun”. I didn’t know how I would create “win conditions” or a
satisfying feeling of “progression”. It wasn’t until years later that I
read [Game Poems by Jordan Magnuson](https://www.gamepoemsbook.com/), and I realized I didn’t
need to limit myself to a “fun” game. _Who Wants To Be
Reincarnated_ would have a different purpose.

_Who Wants to be Reincarnated_ didn’t have a deadline, and so it had to be
completed entirely through self motivation rather than deadline panic. I needed
to want to work on every aspect of the game or else it wouldn’t be finished, so I
cut or readjusted anything I didn’t want to do. For example, originally each
reincarnated individual would have their life story told in paragraphs. I faced
writer’s block for several days because coming up with several short stories for
drastically different individuals in different time periods was too daunting and
demotivating. So I cut out the paragraphs, switched to phrases, and actually
found motivation to keep working on the game.

From there it was simple: Create the
game I wanted to create. I wanted to
encourage people to think about their
thought process when making
reincarnation decisions. I wanted them to
consider their biases, assumptions, and
values. I decided that I would slowly
introduce controversial and provocative
reincarnation questions, so that the
players would have to put more thought
into their answers and question their
previous ones.

I started with the question I would ask
players: “What reincarnation does this
person deserve?”. The wording was very
deliberate. I wanted players to be on the
same page. This wasn’t “What
reincarnation does this person most
resemble?” or “Which reincarnation
would be the most fun?”. This was a
specific value judgement.

And the only things you have to
inform your judgement? Photos
and an assortment of phrases.
The photos can only be glimpsed
through the clouds as they pass
by. Sometimes you only get a
fleeting glimpse, while other
times a cloud passes slowly
enough to take in the person’s
face. Some of the photos have
multiple people, a few even have
hundreds, and there’s no
indication who in that photo will
be reincarnated. One of the
photos has nobody in it, and
your reincarnation options are
only extinct animals.

To view the phrases, you click on a cloud, and the photo piece is replaced with
a phrase. Viewing all the phrases eliminates your ability to see the photo
altogether. One of the things that I think gets lost a bit, is who is creating these
phrases? A person is viewed so differently by their friends, family, strangers,
and by themself. Who gets to decide how someone is remembered in the
afterlife?

The decision making process is meant to be unfair. There’s no right or best
answers. What could you possibly learn from a game like this? I was hoping that
you’d have a lot to learn about yourself. What assumptions do you make right
away? What answers do you lean toward?
