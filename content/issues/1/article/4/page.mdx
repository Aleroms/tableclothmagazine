[Common’hood](https://store.steampowered.com/app/962090/Commonhood/) and is currently working on [Save The Castle!](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2816280/Save_The_Castle/), a VR tower defense
game. Keep an eye out for the new demo releasing during Steam Next Fest on
October 14!

_This interview has been edited for length and clarity._

## What is “Save The Castle!” and how did you end up working on it?

It’s a VR action tower defense that
places you on the field of battle. You
can take over any tower you see. If
you take over an archer tower, you
can shoot bows and arrows. If you
take over a mage tower, you can
shoot fireballs. All the while, you have
to manage your army of towers and
operate them like a traditional tower
defense.

This game was being made with my friend Zachary Day-Scott, whom I met
during Global Game Jam 2020 at UCI.
“Save The Castle!” came about
because we were kicking around
ideas for medium-term games that we
could make to completion, just the two
of us. The design I came up with was:
I thought it’d be really cool to be
standing on top of a castle wall and
seeing the armies come in. And
honestly, we’ve managed to stay pretty close to that vision. I say “we”,
but Zach left the project a couple of
months ago because he got a big boy
job at Niantic. But he was heavily
involved for the first 9 months. Now
it’s just me.

## What makes your game unique in the tower defense genre?

When you actually play it momentto-
moment, it’s more of an action
game. There’s almost no points during
gameplay where you’re not actively
doing something. Between rounds,
there’s downtime for you to rebuild
your towers and build up your armies,
but most of the time it’s an action
game with strategy elements.

The main difference between us and
other VR tower defense games is that
I would describe most of the others as
virtual tabletops. That is to say, you’re
looking down on a virtual table, and
that to me feels like a waste of the
genre. If I’m playing a VR game, I
would want to do things that I could
never do in real life, like throw fireballs
and shoot bows and arrows.

Yeah, if VR is about being immersive,
you took that idea and said “Okay,
let’s actually put us in the tower.”

Exactly, and one dude on Reddit
called me out on this months and
months ago, and it really stuck with
me: “All of your in-tower things don’t
feel like they need to be in VR. They
feel like they could just be on a flat
screen”. And I took that lesson to
heart. Now you have to actually draw
and notch the arrow, as opposed to
before you would just pull the string
and it would fire arrows freely. Same
with the hand cannon. You used to
just pull the trigger and shoot, and
now you have to manually reload it.

## Do you have other examples of how your game has evolved as you learn to design for VR?

People love to pick up stuff in VR. In a
flat screen game, there’s a bunch of
set dressing, but there’s no gameplay
associated with it. Meanwhile with VR,
people like to pick everything up. In
our main menu, you’re in the mage’s
tower. People would try to pick up
objects like the potions, but before
they weren’t grabbable. So that’s one
of the main things I had to go back
and change.

It’s those little touches that nobody
would notice in a flat screen game because it’s not physically possible to walk up and go “Oh, I’m going to pick up this
painting”, but it’s super noticeable in VR when you can’t do it. VR is more immersive,
and your design sensibilities have to reflect that.

## Were they any unique challenges in playtesting?

In our game, in contrast to others I’ve seen, you can freemove and teleport.
Teleporting is great because it means people don’t vomit everywhere, but it doesn’t
have the same fine control that freemoving with the joystick has. So I liked including
both of these.

People also don’t understand grabbing things in VR very intuitively. On the Quest, it’s
a physical button on the side, and that confuses people a lot compared to the trigger,
which is the equivalent of a mouse button. But once you get used to it, it does feel
like you’re picking things up. For the tutorial, I’ve gotten the combat down and how to
take over towers, but you still need to get people used to basic interactions.

In comparison to PC games, there’s no historical control schemes in VR to rely on.

Yeah, that muscle memory is not there with most people. They get used to it
eventually, but I’m curious to see where VR goes in the next decade or so. There wasn’t anything more than like 10
years ago, and the standalone
headsets are pretty darn new too.

## Did you have previous experience working on VR games?

I worked on [Suburban Scully
wags](https://itch.io/jam/vr-jam-2023/rate/2134319), where you played on a
pirate ship going through suburban
neighborhoods and stealing packages
off their porches. That was a
lot of fun, and it was the first VR
game I ever worked on. I didn’t
have a headset at the time, but
Zach got me into it. He was
obsessed with VR and really
wanted to make a game for it. We
made that together as a game jam,
and I fell in love with VR too.

## Did you find working in VR more challenging than traditional games?

Honestly, I was surprised by how
easy the coding transition was.
Software-wise, it’s just Unity.
There’s very few things that are
explicitly different. All of the things
that are different are the game
design sensibilities. You have to
approach designing the game differently because the player is fully
immersed. Wherever you look is game. If
you turn your head physically, it’s still game.

And some of the asset packs we used —
neither of us are artists, so everything
you see physically is an asset pack —
some of them were built to only look
good in screenshots. Sometimes parts of
the objects, like textures, were literally
just missing.

You had to make sure your game models
looked good at all 360 degrees, and you
also had to make sure it works for a
Quest. Yeah, it’s a very low poly art style.

Yeah, it’s a very low poly art style.

Despite the fact that none of it was custom art, we worked very hard on getting a
unified art palette. When I was at Z3 this year, multiple people asked if we did the art
ourselves. And no, it was just careful art direction.

## Did you have to edit a lot of those assets to make it work?

It’s more so picking the ones that fit the scheme we have already. If we see
something that doesn’t necessarily fit, it’ll get replaced with something that does.

## What advice would you give to someone working on a VR game for the first time?

If you’re using Unity, this starter project by [ValemVR](https://github.com/ValemVR/VR-Game-Jam-Template) is a great template to get you
started quickly. Like with anything, start small. If you want to make a VR shooter, just
make a gun that shoots and enemies that move. Get that working before you do
anything else. And that’s just general game advice I’d give to anyone getting into
games.
