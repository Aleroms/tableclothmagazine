Alex Grams is a 2023 UCI and VGDC alumni. This summer, he interned at
Crystal Dynamics as a Gameplay Programmer Intern working on the future of
the Tomb Raider series.

_This interview has been edited for length and clarity._

## What is a Gameplay Programmer and how does it differ from other programming roles?

In order to understand what gameplay programming is, you have to understand what
gameplay is. For example, things like inventory, respawning, fast travel, saving/loading,
skill tree systems, quests, and loot generation can all be gameplay programming.

Other programming roles include AI, core tech (working with the engine itself), tools
(making things that other artists and designers use), UI, and graphics.

Some specific gameplay systems can have an entire team dedicated to it, just because
it’s pretty involved.

## What was the onboarding process like at your internship?

I thought everything would be entirely different when I got into the “big leagues”, but it’s actually fundamentally
the same. We use the same tools. The engine looks the same. I was like okay, I
know how to navigate this. I know how to write a script. Maybe the workflow is
a little different, but fundamentally it’s the same practices. I’ve known how to
do this the whole time. I just never knew it.

It was interesting to see Jira with more
than like 10 people on it, and I had to
somewhat understand the meeting
structure too. But other than that, if I
had a question I would ask my boss or
mentor and they were pretty helpful. I
had an excuse to ask random people on
Slack like stupid questions because I
was an intern, so that’s what I did most
of the time whenever I didn’t
understand something.

I knew more than I thought I knew
going into it, but if I didn’t there
would’ve been ample resources to get
me up to speed.

## How did your internship differ from your previous experiences, like VGDC projects?

One of the biggest things I’ve learned
was working on game projects on scale.
At VGDC it was maybe 10 to 15 people
max. Here, it’s way more than that. You
have tons of people with tons of
experience working on this absolutely
huge project. There’s a lot more stuff to
consider, like being more careful about
the code you submit. I broke the build
like 3 times, which was pretty funny
now but not at the moment, because I
had people pinging me that I broke the
build.

Fundamentally, it’s the same as the
projects at VGDC, but it’s at a much
larger scale. It’s like how building a
house is fundamentally the same as
building a city, just at a much larger
scale. You gotta build rooms and you do
that many times and on top of each
other. That’s the analogy I would make.

## What have you learned from this internship?

I learned the difference between a
smart programmer and a so􀏔ware
engineer. Sometimes the designers
make prototypes that become
permanent. When we need to expand
these systems further, we find that they
weren’t designed to be expanded or
changed. I worked on one of these
systems for a month, redesigning it and
removing tech debt. I gained an
appreciation for software engineering
and how to write code that’s
maintainable and readable.

It also gave me first-hand experience on
what experienced software engineers
look like. One time, I was like: “Hey
boss, I’m trying to decide between
method 1 or method 2.” He said: “Do
method 1. That’s so much better. We
tried method 2 and it sucked.” If he
didn’t have that experience, we’d
probably have to sit in a meeting and
discuss it, but he just knows off the bat
because he’s done it before. That’s what
you get with experience. You get to
figure out these design decisions super
fast.

## How did you find this internship, and what was the application process like?

[Gamejobs.co](https://gamejobs.co). I was just farming that
website everyday and applying to
everything on there.

It was a standard process, but every job
application is a roller coaster. You get
your hopes up, then you think you did
terrible, then you get your hopes up
again because you get to the next stage,
and then you think you did terrible
again until it’s over.

## Did you feel like you had a lot of opportunities to talk to people?

I felt like I could message anybody at
any time about anything. Even the head
of the studio, but I never felt the need
to do that.

People started messaging me about
stuff too. It was mostly about “Hey your
system is broken” or “How does your
system work?” I ended up owning that
system I made and becoming an expert
in it.

## How were your tasks assigned?

My boss and the intern mentors had it
all planned out for each week, but we
got through all of that in one month.
They started just giving us JIRAs as
they came up.

They had two separate plans for me and
the other graphics intern. She got a
deep understanding of one part of the
graphics, and I got a broad
understanding of gameplay in general.
They had me working on a variety of
systems, which was exactly what I had
asked for.

So for me I worked on anything that
came up. At one point late in my
internship, the design team gave us
some docs with features they wanted.
By then, the boss and mentors were
pretty confident in us, so they let us
handle that on our own. We talked to
the designers and we went through the
process of understanding what they
wanted and getting feedback.

The tasks sort of evolved as they
learned how capable the interns were. I
don’t think the intern mentors or my
boss ever had to baby us. I would ask
questions when I needed to, but for the
most part I handled stuff on my own,
and I was fine with that. I was basically part of the team, just handing
things on a smaller scale.

## Do you have any advice for the people applying to internships now?

I’ve been trying to figure out the secret
sauce. I don’t think it exists. I’ve talked
to recruiters, and they give the same
advice as what you’ve seen on the
internet. Point is, you have to brute
force it. You have to have the skills
needed, you have to have a good
resume, and you have to have projects.

One of the things they emphasized was
that they valued the ability to learn.
Being inquisitive, asking questions, and
giving the impression that you want to
learn about things about your job can
go a long way.

It’s very key to have the projects to back
up what you know. The projects I did at
VGDC helped me more than anything
else towards getting a job in games. It
gave me examples of how I worked as a
so􀏔ware engineer, how I would go
about solving problems, and proving to
them that I’m a competent so􀏔ware
engineer.
