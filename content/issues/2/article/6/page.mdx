Frankly, I shouldn’t have to justify playing through the
_Mass Effect_ trilogy on easy mode. The option was there,
and as the Twitter account for Doom Eternal once said: “
You control the buttons you press.”[^1] That being said, I have
always felt an implied derision of easy mode in the gaming
zeitgeist. Maybe it’s the proliferation of ultra hard games like
the Souls series (and all its many, many clones) that pride themselves
on difficulty in their mechanics.

_Mass Effect_ is an entirely different genre, however!
The point of _Mass Effect_ is not the combat. The point of
_Mass Effect_ is to make paper dolls of Tali and Shepard go _smooch
smooch smooch smooch smooch_. It has combat, sure, but the fights
serve as something to do between story and character sections. It was the
writing that kept me booting the game every night, not the shooting. It’s a series
rich in world-building, spanning a complex and interesting sci-fi Milky Way.
Dying repeatedly to unimportant fights was not increasing my enjoyment of the
game; it was making me frustrated, and taking time away that could be better
spent listening to Mordin sing to us that he is the very model of a scientist
Salarian. I’m supposed to be Space Hero Shepard! Not Private Joe Schmoe who
was the first one killed in the Reaper invasion.

So I dropped the difficulty! And you know what happened? The game became
more fun! I even leaned into the roleplay of it. After all, Shepard is the greatest
soldier the galaxy has ever seen. It’s only natural that I should be mowing down
the legions of copy-pasted Blue Sun goons the game throws at you. And the
game still had challenge! I still died occasionally, but now I wasn’t getting
frustrated or stuck. If I was an expert pro-gamer with lightning reflexes, I
probably wouldn’t have died so many times on medium difficulty. However, I will
not apologize for kinda sucking at a single player shooter
whose third installment came out before Romney failed to
win the White House.

In the arcade cabinet era, even suggesting an easy
mode would likely have gotten you forcibly ejected
from Atari’s boardroom. Thankfully, we no longer
design video games with the express intention of
taking as many quarters from children’s pockets as
humanly possible. ~(Instead, games like Fortnite have
evolved much more sophisticated strategies, like
credit cards)~.

If the point of your game is nightmarish difficulty, then crank up
the boss health and don’t include a difficulty slider. But if that isn’t the
intended experience of your game, absolutely include those crutches! Easy
mode in _Mass Effect_ (and most other shooters) means players do more damage
and have more health, while the inverse is true for enemies. This gives players a
bit of leeway in landing their shots and tanking enemy fire, while still allowing
the full game experience.

Developers of story-rich single player experiences want their players to finish
their games! Of course they do! It’d be like making a movie and _hoping_ people
left halfway and never came back. If dropping a game to easy is what it takes for
you to beat it, do it with your head held high.
