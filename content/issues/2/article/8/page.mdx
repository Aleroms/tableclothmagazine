There's a piece of advice I hear a lot that's
told to newcomers to the GDIM major:
"Make sure you join a pitch project!"
Indeed, most of the classes we take are
not enough to build a portfolio on their
own. A quarter-long project can fit that
role. But these also come with their own
problems. Quarter-long projects often
involve large groups of people that need
to be coordinated through ten weeks of
school. Inevitably, some team members
(to no fault of their own) will have to drop
out. This time commitment in the midst
of college ended up being too much for
me most quarters. And yet, I still ended
up with fourteen games (in addition to
those made for classes) on my portfolio
by the end of my four year stay at UCI.
Where did these games come from? Enter
the game jam.

Quarter-long projects do something
important: they force you to try to make a
game. Game Design is a creative
profession with creative people, but
creative people often have a hard time
finishing projects (I am also guilty of this).

A quarter-long project has a set
end-date, so most teams will
have something they can say they
made by the end of them. But
there are the aforementioned
time conflicts. Game jams offer a
solution to this: Instead of ten
weeks of work, you're only given
two days at least, or a month at
most to make a game (I often do
three day game jams). If you want
to do a game jam, there's less of a
time commitment compared to
doing a quarter-long project. In
my Sophomore year, I was too
busy with a six unit assembly
coding course to do a
quarter-long project. But I still
had time to do a three-day game
jam. There's also less pressure for
failure. Seeing ten weeks of work
go down the drain can be
heartbreaking. Seeing three days
of work fail still stings, but not
nearly as much.

Less pressure to fail also means
you can take more risks. I've
worked a lot of roles during game
jams: I've been a writer, an artist,
a game designer, and a
programmer. When I started
doing game jams, I didn't feel like
I wanted to lead my own project.
I always offered my programming
services to other teams. But most
programmers were in the same
situation as me: we were forced
to lead our own teams. Being
forced to lead a team is how I
realized that I love doing
production work. I had a two
week game jam where I was
coordinating one artist and eight
composers. The process of
talking to everyone, getting
information in documents,
setting deadlines, and figuring
out how to scope properly was a
ton of fun. That game I led also
ended up placing second overall
in the game jam. During
quarter-long projects, I felt
pressured into doing roles that I
already knew. After all, I didn't
want to let a big project down
because I wanted to try
something new. That would have
been on me. But in the short span
of game jams, I felt more free in
pursuing new fields. I probably
wouldn't know that I like
production work if I tried to just
join quarter-long projects.
Being put on the spot during the game
jam helped me learn more about what I
want to do when I make games. I've
watched great artists become great
programmers, and great programmers
become great writers. Game jams offer a
chance for you to discover yourself.

At UCI, there are three standard quarters.
This means that if you join two projects
every year, you might end up with eight
games on your portfolio. This schedule is
one of the best things about how the
project system is set-up. If you follow it
even just 66% of the time, you'll graduate
with a good resume. Instead of doing
quarter-long projects, I did game jams.
I'm in a community that does around
three game jams every year. That means
with the same 66% rate, I ended up with a
similar amount of games. In my opinion,
what's important for building a portfolio
is a constant stream of events to make
games. For some people, that's
quarter-long projects. For others, that's
game jams.

Of course, there's a difference between
making a game in ten weeks, and making
a game in three days. Sometimes, scope
changes. A ten week game can have more
content than a game jam game. Ten week
games are also almost always more
polished than game jam games. But there
is an interesting effect that happens with
being "forced to finish". With only a few
days to work on something, developers
often put all they have into a game jam
game. A coding problem that might
take a week to solve in a quarter-long
project might be solved in a few
hours. A background that an artist
might've spent three weeks on could
be done in a day for a jam game. I've
created several jam games with more
content than some of my longer term
projects. Of course, it's not a simple
trade-off. Game jams will lead to less
sleep than longer term projects.
There's also less polish as described
before. But, game jam games can be
just as rich as quarter-long games.

I've been in the Touhou Game Jam
Community for four years, and I've
witnessed a lot of incredible
achievements. I've watched four game
jam games blossom into full Steam
releases. I've watched hobbyists
realize that they can make a career
out of making games. I have a friend
who started doing game jams when
he was 17. He continued to do those
jams to hone in his craft after
high school. Just two years later, he
made around 25 thousand dollars in
a month from a game he made with
his brother. Recently, there's been
an eager high schooler from Iran
who's been doing game jams to
learn more about game
development. From his experiences
designing games for jams, he was
able to win a local game jam. These
people didn't enroll in a game design
program, instead, they learned
thanks to the jams the Touhou
Game Dev Hub hosted.

This article isn't meant to shoot
down the idea of quarter-long
projects. Instead, I wanted to show
that there isn't one sole path
forward. If you feel like you want to
try something a bit different than
quarter-long projects or if you're
eager to get a game done fast, then I
encourage you to try doing game
jams. These are a constant part of
my life now, and I'm happier
because of them.
