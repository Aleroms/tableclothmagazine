I currently work part time as an activity leader for English Learning (EL, or
alternatively ESL for English Second Language) high school students. My job is to
run games and activities in order to provide EL students with a casual
environment to practice language comprehension and speaking skills. This
involves many parallels to game development such as regularly iterating, seeking
feedback, and most importantly, trying to make things fun. I am not a certified
teacher, and my program is not tutoring, as several of my students have
erroneously described it. Nevertheless, I hope that they can learn from the
experience, and maybe you can too!

Among my materials are word cards, conversation prompts, magnet letters, and
classic tabletop games like Pictionary and Headbandz. These materials form a
good foundational set of activities, but as a game developer, I always wonder what other games we could play.

For example, I'm interested in taking
inspiration from theatre games (or
theater if you prefer). I'd dabbled with
theatre games and improv during
high school, and over the summer, I
tried to run them with younger
students. Theatre games inspire my
current work because many of them
involve listening, speaking, and
reacting. In a classroom setting, it is
possible to include everyone in a
collaborative audience-performer
relationship even if fewer students
are “on-stage”.

A more recent interest of mine is
tabletop games. Tabletop games are
fascinating to me because they use
diverse game mechanics to represent
any number of outcomes. The roll of a
die can be a mathematical tool, an
indicator of success, or a determiner
for a table of results. Game pieces are
tactile and fun to hold. And when it
comes to tabletop RPG’s, it’s even
possible to use the same collaborative
storytelling as theatre games to
create a shared story full of
opportunities to speak and listen.

All of this comes together in one
game I drew up called Word Battle.
One free afternoon, I set pen to paper
and drafted up a simple vocabulary
game. I wanted to make a lightly
competitive game with a level of
tension that would be entertaining to
watch. Inspired by tabletop games, I
used game tokens that I 3D modeled
and printed myself in my design.
Players must write down words
related to a given theme each round,
and use the game tokens to indicate
an attack or defense. A player wins by
reducing the other player's health to
zero. Playtesting was absolutely
crucial to this experience. After I had
drafted the initial rules and
considered the possible outcomes of
each interaction, I had some of my
coworkers play my game. Something
was missing. The arbitrary values for
health and damage were off, but more
than that, there was no sense of
tension. The game just wasn't
exciting.

In collaborative works, the best ideas
sometimes come from the people
you're working with. My coworkers
identified where the game felt slow,
and I brainstormed a key mechanic
called Word Clashes, borrowing from
a theatre game of word relations. In
addition, with my coworkers' help, I
tuned the numbers and added new
rules to keep the matches fast and
the stakes high. Through watching
my coworkers play and observing
moments of confusion, I improved
the experience in collaboration with
my playtesters.

My competition is board games with
colorful boxes, fun game pieces, and
physical rules, so early on, I decided
that I wanted to design a poster or
rules sheet for my game. I’d tried
making posters to promote my program before. My earliest attempts had all the
relevant details of who, what, where, and when, but what they were really saying
was “Graphic Design is not my passion”.

Clearly, I needed some help beyond quick Youtube breakdowns of basic graphic
design, so I reached out to a graphic designer friend. One evening, they were
kind enough to walk me through some fundamentals. Going over my attempts,
they pointed out the weaknesses of my presentation and gave advice on where
to improve. With their guidance, I was able to not only make a more cohesive
rules sheet for Word Battle, but I also vastly improved the flyer for my program
too. To sum it up: try your best, have something you can bring to the feedback
table, and ask for help. People in your network are awesome, and they're there to
support you when you need it. It’s very important to have your friends and family
tell you straight, “Riley, this flyer sucks”.

You’re not going to believe this, but what
came next might surprise you. More
playtesting. Armed with a printed copy of
my new rules sheet, I approached two
other coworkers and had them playtest
not just my game, but my rules too. For
the most part, it went smoothly, except
when it didn't. Some parts, my players
didn’t read carefully, some parts, my
words could have been more carefully
written. After ironing out the wrinkles in
the rules, everything went smoothly even
though my players managed to go the
entire game without triggering a Word
Clash. With the notes and observations
from this session, I'm armed and ready for
another round of iteration.

Full disclosure, I haven't had the
opportunity to try Word Battle with my
EL students. This is partly a matter of
attendance, but also it's because language
is hard, and not all of my students have
the vocabulary to tackle it yet. In this way,
my game has failed in reaching its
intended audience. However, the process
has served as an excellent exercise in
design and iteration. I worked with the
materials that I had and made an activity
that I think has potential when my
students are ready for it. For my non-EL
students, I'm pleased to report that a
couple of them tried it, and they found
Word Battle fun enough to play without
me. What's left is to iterate on my
process, try again, and continue making
games that my students can enjoy.

I'm telling you all of this because making up games and activities through my
work has given me the chance to develop and iterate games in ways I failed to in
the past. Playtesting in person, easier post-Covid lockdown but harder out of
school, has been extremely valuable. With my students, I can quickly see what's
working and what's not. Additionally, I get to interact with different types of
people every day. Researching other games has been helpful, too. My current
work in designing games with a specific goal and reaching a specific audience is
great exercise for something I don't think I considered enough in the past. All
this to say, I'm still iterating, learning, and growing. I'm thankful for my
coworkers, students, playtesters, and friends. I hope that through my work, I can
make some fun. If you're like me on this perpetual path of self-improvement and
game development, I hope you find every opportunity to keep growing and find
your own coworkers, friends, and connections that will support you too.
