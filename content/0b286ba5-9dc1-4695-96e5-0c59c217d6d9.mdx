If you're a game dev, you’ve almost certainly interacted with a game engine;
however, I often find definitions of them are frustratingly lacking or vague.
The generally accepted, “A game engine is a tool used to make a game” is a
good start, but ultimately too broad. We know C++ and Maya are used
extensively in game development, but they aren’t game engines. We end up in
a, “Well I know it when I see it” mentality, which I believe should be clarified.

## A Story in Three Parts

Early in my career, a very senior engineer gave me a definition that I
think captures it best. He proposed that a game engine is actually three
separate things: a runtime, an editor, and the resources/resource formats
that they share.

- The **runtime** is
  the executable
  you ship to the
  player, which
  contains all the
  code you write.

- The **editor** is likely
  the part you would
  see the most; this is
  the Unity, Godot, or
  Unreal that you have
  interacted with as a
  gamedev.

- The **resources** are what
  the editor generates
  and what the runtime
  uses, with the formats
  being the shared
  understanding of how
  the resources should
  be interacted with.

The composite of these three parts form a game engine.

## Resources/Formats

A game is made of a lot of different things:
models, materials, physics colliders, levels,
textures, scripts, prefabs, and everything in
between. These are the assets that make a game.
These resources can oftentimes be game-specific
or engine-specific, and in rare cases platform
specific. Sometimes they are represented as some
general format like JPG or FBX, but many game
engines will actually transform that format into
its own version. This custom format is often the
agreed upon format that the editor creates and
the runtime uses.

## Editor

The editor is likely the part everyone can
visualize in their head: a view port, a list of game
objects, a file explorer, and a million other editors
and widgets. This is what we would call a DCC
tool or a “digital content creation” tool. Given
that runtime operates on resources, we need
something that can make those resources.

Due to the very custom and specific nature of
games, the resources oftentimes need their own
editors. If you are making a fighting game, you
will need editors that control per-frame hit and
hurt boxes, as the frame data is a resource. If
you're making an RPG, you may need an editor for
quest design. Node-based scripting requires their
own editor, same with shader graphs! There are a
lot of resource types in video games, so there
needs to be a lot of custom editors.

## Runtime

The runtime is the engine code that underlies all
of the behaviors your players will interact with.
Despite its ubiquity, this large mass of code is
fairly invisible, especially if you're an artist or
designer. Programmers, however, will need to be
keenly aware of this amorphous blob of text that
you interact with.

One of the biggest things I've learned is that the
runtime is subdivided into even more layers.
These don’t have industry-standard names, so I’m
going to put them in three categories: _game code,
systems code,_ and _abstraction code._

## Game Code

This is the code you write that will run on an end user's hardware.
These snippets of code rely on modifying or acting on resources to
provide your player with a fun experience. This is essentially the
top of the stack, and is what most people think about when
programming with a game engine. However there is a vast amount
of code that makes this possible: _the systems code._

## Systems Code

Systems is all the game specific code a game may need and exists
as the middle section of the runtime. These are the pieces of code
that you will likely interact with while writing scripts, and have
been built to drive the game using the resources you’ve made.
Things like transforms, loading scenes, physics, collison, render
pipelines, and modifying resources all live here. Your scripts are
driving an underlying simulation that has been crafted to be
malleable and allow you to make what you’d like without having to
worry about the vast amount of complexity tied to a game.

This section also influences how you craft your scripting and
interact with your resources. Engines tend to architect their
scripting based on patterns, like the older Unity-styled entity
component architecture, actor pawn, entity component systems,
and maybe some weird combination of them. It also provides the
APIs for working with resources, like adjusting material
parameters or changing animation states. Games using the same
engine often feel slightly similar due to the shared systems code. A
good example is how Unreal’s systems are very tailored towards
shooters or action games, whereas RPG Maker has systems tailored
for RPGs.

## Abstraction Code

This is the bottom of the stack. Video games must run on all
available hardware but with minimal overhead. That sounds
simple but it can be infuriatingly difficult. OS differences,
graphics API differences, hardware differences, compilers,
input devices, platform certification, deployment, and even
the availability of standard libraries in older consoles makes
releasing cross platforms games an interesting challenge. To
this end, engines often develop abstractions to handle these
variables. Instead of writing a Vulkan, Direct X, and Metal
renderer, engines create a singular rendering abstraction on
top of those. File access, math libraries with varying levels of
hardware support, networking stacks, input handling, and
even memory allocations all get interfaces that wrap the wild
west of the low level. In doing so we create a stable and
consistent interface that only requires a change when a
paradigm shift occurs at that level (such as the OpenGL to
Vulkan jump). It's also worth noting that this section is fairly
useful even in a non-game context, as no game concepts
should leak into this level. A good example of these would be
SDL, GLFW, GLM, and even the C++ standard library.

## Why Distinguish Them?

With those 3 pieces described, we
now have the components that
make a game engine! When this
was originally laid out I thought
“But why split it up?” Why not just
edit the game in the game or build
the editor into the game itself? The
answer is that an editor and the
runtime both work with resources
but have absolutely different
concerns. The runtime only needs
to read the resources and be fast.
An editor both reads and edits the
resources, but its main intent is to
provide maximum flexibility in
authorship. That’s a completely
different set of problems, with a
very different set of answers.

As an example, consider a 2d block
based platformer. It's functionally a
tile-based game, with some tiles
denoting ground, some breakable
blocks, and some pipes. If you
contextualize Mario as a grid of
squares, you don’t need much to
make a playable level. Excel sheets
are essentially grids of blocks with
data. This could be your resource.
Instead of having artists manually
move blocks into place or
painstakingly set up transforms,
you can make a grid of data, save it
as a resource, and have the game
build the level based on the
resource.

Then you can make runtime
optimizations against the level data, like
merging colliders for the ground, so you
don’t need to have so many colliders and
physics objects.

This doesn’t only apply to old games
either. In their REAC 2024[^1] talk, Santa
Monica Studios showed that they don’t
have an in-house editor. The entirety of
God of War’s game resources were made
in Maya. This meant the art team didn’t
need to learn new tools and could
quickly integrate their work into the
game without needing to import and
export from one program to another.
Using Maya’s plugins, they created a
workflow for everyone leveraging
industry- standard tools while also
viewing the game running on a
Playstation. In a highly tailored and
cinematic game like God of War, the
usage of cinema tools makes a lot of
sense. Of course there are drawbacks to
relying on something like this, but I’d
recommend the talk as it's an interesting
look into a cool workflow.
The editor doesn’t even need to be
written in C++ or be a native application.
An extremely cool and unique editor
choice was made by Insomniac Games
where their editor was a webpage that
was only accessible on their local
network via a browser[^2]. This let them
have a centralized version control
system, quickly churn out new tools via
JavaScript, and distribute new editors
instantly. Ultimately this was abandoned
for a variety of reasons (ads popping up
in a game editor is concerning), but they
did ship multiple games using this workflow. This shows that the act of making
resources and the act of running a game can be
completely detached.

Another Insomniac example can be found in
Spider Man on PS4[^3]. The game was too big to fit
on disk, but they found that they could compress
the models’ data to save 5 GBs of space. The catch
was that the compression technique would mean
that editors like Maya wouldn’t know how to read
the models. However because of the separation of
runtime and editing, that was a non-problem.
Compression would be applied at final model
compilation, editing time would stay the same,
and runtime would be drastically improved.

Another example of how this benefits runtime is
in loading assets. Human-readable assets are nice
for humans but not for the computer. If you
compile your assets to a runtime format, you can
simplify your serialization code and improve load
and processing time. Compiling assets can also
break the ability to edit them, but that’s ok, as the
editor maintains the human readable assets
giving us the best of both worlds with sacrifices
to neither.

If we think about a game engine as an editor, a
runtime, and the shared resources, we decouple
the vast set of technical problems and open up
new opportunities to optimize both.
